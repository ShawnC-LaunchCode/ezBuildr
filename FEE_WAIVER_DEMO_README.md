# Fee Waiver Application Demo Workflow

**Created:** November 26, 2025
**Workflow ID:** `81a73b18-012d-458b-af05-5098eb75c753`
**Project:** Demo Project

## Overview

This is a comprehensive demonstration workflow that showcases VaultLogic's core features through a real-world use case: a court fee waiver application. The workflow demonstrates conditional logic, calculations, file uploads, and data transformations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This workflow helps users:
1. Determine if they qualify for a court fee waiver based on income and household size
2. Collect all necessary information for the application
3. Calculate qualification thresholds automatically
4. Gather supporting documentation
5. Generate a completed application form

## 📋 Workflow Structure

### Section 1: Applicant Information
Collects basic personal details:
- **Name fields** (first, middle, last) - demonstrates multiple related text inputs
- **Date of Birth** - demonstrates date_time field type
- **Address** (street, city, state, ZIP) - demonstrates structured address collection
- **Contact** (phone, email) - demonstrates communication field types

**Variables (Aliases):**
- `firstName`, `middleName`, `lastName`
- `dateOfBirth`
- `streetAddress`, `city`, `state`, `zipCode`
- `phoneNumber`, `emailAddress`

### Section 2: Household & Income
Collects household composition and income information:
- **Household Size** (dropdown 1-8+) - drives poverty level calculations
- **Employment Status** (radio buttons) - triggers conditional logic
- **Employer Name** - conditionally required based on employment
- **Monthly Income** fields - used in calculations
- **Public Benefits** (multi-select) - auto-qualification trigger

**Variables:**
- `householdSize`, `employmentStatus`, `employerName`
- `monthlyIncome`, `otherIncome`
- `publicBenefits`

**Transform Blocks (Calculated Values):**
1. **Total Monthly Income** → `totalMonthlyIncome`
   - Sums employment income + other income

2. **Poverty Threshold (150%)** → `povertyThreshold`
   - Calculates qualification threshold based on household size
   - Uses 2024 Federal Poverty Level guidelines

3. **Qualification Status** → `qualificationStatus`
   - Determines if applicant likely qualifies
   - Returns: "Likely Qualified" or "Additional Review Required"
   - Considers both income threshold and public benefits

### Section 3: Monthly Expenses
Collects detailed expense information:
- Rent/Mortgage, Utilities, Food, Transportation
- Medical, Childcare, Other expenses

**Variables:**
- `expenseRent`, `expenseUtilities`, `expenseFood`
- `expenseTransportation`, `expenseMedical`, `expenseChildcare`
- `expenseOther`

**Transform Blocks:**
1. **Total Monthly Expenses** → `totalMonthlyExpenses`
   - Sums all expense categories

2. **Disposable Income** → `disposableIncome`
   - Calculates: Total Income - Total Expenses
   - Shows financial capacity to pay fees

### Section 4: Assets & Liabilities
Collects financial assets and debts:
- Cash/bank accounts, vehicle value, real estate
- Other assets, total debt

**Variables:**
- `cashAndBank`, `vehicleValue`, `realEstateValue`
- `otherAssets`, `totalDebt`

**Transform Blocks:**
1. **Total Assets** → `totalAssets`
   - Sums all asset categories

2. **Net Worth** → `netWorth`
   - Calculates: Total Assets - Total Debt

**Conditional Logic:**
- **Hidden if qualified by income** - Section skipped if `qualificationStatus` = "Likely Qualified"
- This demonstrates section-level conditional logic

### Section 5: Supporting Documents
File upload section for evidence:
- Pay stubs, bank statements, benefit proof, other documents
- Each accepts PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG
- 5MB max file size per upload
- Multiple files allowed

**Variables:**
- `payStubs`, `bankStatements`, `benefitProof`, `otherDocuments`

**Conditional Logic:**
- **Pay stubs required if employed** - Triggers when employment status is full-time or part-time

### Section 6: Review & Certification
Final review and certification:
- Additional information (long text field)
- Certification checkbox - required for submission

**Variables:**
- `additionalInfo`, `certification`

## 🧮 Calculations & Logic

### Transform Blocks (7 total)

All transform blocks use JavaScript and execute in a sandboxed environment:

1. **Calculate Total Monthly Income**
   - Inputs: `monthlyIncome`, `otherIncome`
   - Output: `totalMonthlyIncome`
   - Phase: onSectionSubmit (Section 2)

2. **Calculate Poverty Level Threshold**
   - Input: `householdSize`
   - Output: `povertyThreshold`
   - Uses 2024 FPL guidelines (150% threshold)
   - Phase: onSectionSubmit (Section 2)

3. **Determine Qualification Status**
   - Inputs: `totalMonthlyIncome`, `povertyThreshold`, `publicBenefits`
   - Output: `qualificationStatus`
   - Logic: Qualified if income ≤ threshold OR receives public benefits
   - Phase: onSectionSubmit (Section 2)

4. **Calculate Total Monthly Expenses**
   - Inputs: All expense fields
   - Output: `totalMonthlyExpenses`
   - Phase: onSectionSubmit (Section 3)

5. **Calculate Disposable Income**
   - Inputs: `totalMonthlyIncome`, `totalMonthlyExpenses`
   - Output: `disposableIncome`
   - Phase: onSectionSubmit (Section 3)

6. **Calculate Total Assets**
   - Inputs: All asset fields
   - Output: `totalAssets`
   - Phase: onSectionSubmit (Section 4)

7. **Calculate Net Worth**
   - Inputs: `totalAssets`, `totalDebt`
   - Output: `netWorth`
   - Phase: onSectionSubmit (Section 4)

### Conditional Logic Rules (5 total)

1. **Require Employer Name (Full-Time)**
   - Condition: `employmentStatus` equals "Employed Full-Time"
   - Action: Require `employerName` field

2. **Require Employer Name (Part-Time)**
   - Condition: `employmentStatus` equals "Employed Part-Time"
   - Action: Require `employerName` field

3. **Hide Assets Section If Qualified**
   - Condition: `qualificationStatus` equals "Likely Qualified"
   - Action: Hide Assets & Liabilities section
   - Purpose: Streamline workflow for clearly qualified applicants

4. **Require Pay Stubs (Full-Time)**
   - Condition: `employmentStatus` equals "Employed Full-Time"
   - Action: Require `payStubs` upload

5. **Require Pay Stubs (Part-Time)**
   - Condition: `employmentStatus` equals "Employed Part-Time"
   - Action: Require `payStubs` upload

2. Monthly income: $1,500
3. No other income
4. **Expected:** Qualification status = "Likely Qualified", Assets section hidden

#### Scenario 2: Public Benefits Auto-Qualify
1. Select any public benefit (SNAP, SSI, etc.)
2. **Expected:** Qualification status = "Likely Qualified" regardless of income

#### Scenario 3: Employed - Conditional Requirements
1. Employment status: "Employed Full-Time"
2. **Expected:** Employer name required, pay stubs required

#### Scenario 4: High Income - Full Application
1. Household size: 1
2. Monthly income: $3,000
3. **Expected:** Must complete all sections including assets

### Testing Calculations

You can verify calculations using the Preview Runner:

**Poverty Thresholds (150% of FPL):**
- 1 person: $1,822.50/month
- 2 people: $2,466/month
- 3 people: $3,108/month
- 4 people: $3,750/month

Example: 2-person household with $2,000/month income → Qualified ✓
