## Understanding Variables

### What Are Variables?

In VaultLogic, **variables** are human-friendly names you give to workflow steps so you can easily reference the data collected in those steps. Instead of using cryptic step IDs like `step-abc-123-xyz`, you can use meaningful names like `clientName`, `email`, or `signatureDate`.

**Example:**
```
Without Variables:
  Step ID: step-f3a9c2d1-4b8e-4d9f-a1c3-7e8f9a0b1c2d
  Question: "What is your first name?"

With Variables:
  Variable Name: firstName
  Question: "What is your first name?"
```

### Why Use Variables?

1. **Readability** - `{firstName}` is easier to understand than `{step-abc-123}`
2. **Maintainability** - Variables don't change when you reorganize your workflow
3. **Documentation** - Self-documenting templates that anyone can understand
4. **Collaboration** - Team members can work on templates without confusion
5. **Reusability** - Templates can be adapted to different workflows easily

### How Variables Work

**The Journey of Data:**

1. **Collection** - User fills out workflow step (e.g., enters their name)
2. **Storage** - Data saved with variable name (e.g., `firstName = "John"`)
3. **Reference** - Template uses placeholder (e.g., `{firstName}`)
4. **Generation** - Document created with actual value (e.g., "John")

**Visual Flow:**
```
Workflow Step               Variable            Document Template
┌─────────────────┐        ┌──────────┐        ┌─────────────────┐
│ "Enter your     │   →    │firstName │   →    │ Hello {firstName}│
│  first name"    │        │ = "John" │        │                 │
│                 │        └──────────┘        │ Output:         │
│ [John      ]    │                             │ Hello John      │
└─────────────────┘                             └─────────────────┘
```

## Creating Variables

### Step 1: Add Steps to Your Workflow

First, create the steps that will collect data:

1. Open your workflow in the Visual Builder
2. Add a section (e.g., "Client Information")
3. Add steps (questions) to collect data

### Step 2: Assign Variable Names

For each step that collects data you want to use in documents:

1. **Select the step** in the sidebar
2. **Find "Variable (alias)" field** in the Step Settings panel
3. **Enter a descriptive name** (e.g., `clientName`, `serviceDate`)
4. **See the variable badge** appear next to the step in the sidebar

**Naming Rules:**
- Use camelCase: `firstName`, not `first_name` or `FirstName`
- Be descriptive: `clientEmail` is better than `email1`
- No spaces or special characters
- Must be unique within the workflow
- Cannot start with a number

**Good Variable Names:**
```
✓ firstName
✓ clientName
✓ effectiveDate
✓ totalAmount
✓ serviceType
✓ signatureDate
✓ billingAddress
✓ phoneNumber
```

**Poor Variable Names:**
```
✗ name1              (too generic)
✗ first name         (has space)
✗ First-Name         (has hyphen)
✗ 1stName            (starts with number)
✗ x                  (not descriptive)
✗ temp               (unclear purpose)
```

### Step 3: Document Your Variables

Keep a list of variables for reference:

| Variable Name | Question | Type | Example Value |
|--------------|----------|------|---------------|
| `clientName` | What is your company name? | Short Text | "Acme Corp" |
| `contactEmail` | Primary contact email? | Short Text | "john@acme.com" |
| `serviceType` | Type of service needed? | Radio | "Tax Preparation" |
| `startDate` | When should we begin? | Date | "2025-01-15" |

## Basic Variable Usage in Documents

### Simple Text Replacement

The most common use case: replace a placeholder with collected data.

**Template:**
```
Dear {clientName},

Thank you for choosing our services. We will contact you at {contactEmail}.
```

**Workflow Setup:**
- Step 1: "What is your company name?" → Variable: `clientName`
- Step 2: "Primary contact email?" → Variable: `contactEmail`

**Sample Data:**
```json
{
  "clientName": "Acme Corp",
  "contactEmail": "john@acme.com"
}
```

**Generated Document:**
```
Dear Acme Corp,

Thank you for choosing our services. We will contact you at john@acme.com.
```

---

### Using Multiple Variables

Most documents need many variables. Here's a complete engagement letter example:

**Template:**
```
ENGAGEMENT LETTER

Date: {formatDate currentDate "MMMM DD, YYYY"}

Dear {clientName},

This letter confirms our engagement to provide {serviceType} services for
{companyName}, effective {formatDate effectiveDate "MMMM DD, YYYY"}.

Point of Contact: {contactPerson}
Email: {contactEmail}
Phone: {contactPhone}

Our fee for this engagement is {formatCurrency feeAmount "USD"}.

Sincerely,
{accountantName}
{firmName}
```

**Workflow Variables:**
```
currentDate      → Current date (auto-populated)
clientName       → "John Smith" (client's name)
serviceType      → "tax preparation" (service selected)
companyName      → "Smith Industries LLC" (company name)
effectiveDate    → "2025-01-01" (start date)
contactPerson    → "Jane Doe" (main contact)
contactEmail     → "jane@smithind.com" (email)
contactPhone     → "(555) 123-4567" (phone)
feeAmount        → 2500.00 (fee amount)
accountantName   → "Robert Johnson, CPA" (your name)
firmName         → "Johnson & Associates" (your firm)
```

**Generated Document:**
```
ENGAGEMENT LETTER

Date: November 14, 2025

### Nested Variables (Grouped Data)

Organize related variables using dot notation:

**Template:**
```
CLIENT INFORMATION

Name: {client.firstName} {client.lastName}
Company: {client.companyName}
Address: {client.address.street}
         {client.address.city}, {client.address.state} {client.address.zip}

PRIMARY CONTACT

Name: {contact.name}
Email: {contact.email}
Phone: {contact.phone}
```

**Workflow Variables:**
```
client.firstName      → "John"
client.lastName       → "Smith"
client.companyName    → "Acme Corp"
client.address.street → "123 Main Street"
client.address.city   → "Springfield"
client.address.state  → "IL"
client.address.zip    → "62701"
contact.name          → "Jane Doe"
contact.email         → "jane@acme.com"
contact.phone         → "(555) 123-4567"
```

**Note:** You can create nested structures by using dots in your variable names when setting up workflow steps.

```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Variable Naming Conventions

**Use Consistent Patterns:**
```
✓ Good Pattern (camelCase):
  firstName, lastName, emailAddress
  companyName, streetAddress, zipCode
  startDate, endDate, effectiveDate
  basePrice, taxRate, totalAmount

✗ Inconsistent:
  FirstName, last_name, email-address
  Company_Name, StreetAddr, zip
```

**Group Related Variables:**
```
✓ Grouped:
  client.firstName
  client.lastName
  client.email

  billing.address
  billing.city
  billing.state

✗ Flat (harder to manage):
  clientFirstName
  clientLastName
  clientEmail
  billingAddress
  billingCity
  billingState
```

---

### 2. Document Your Templates

Create a "Template Guide" document for each template:

**Example Template Guide:**

```markdown
# Engagement Letter Template - Variable Reference

## Required Variables
- clientName (text) - Client's full name or company name
- serviceType (text) - Type of service being provided
- effectiveDate (date) - When services begin
- feeAmount (number) - Total fee amount

## Optional Variables
- discountPercent (number) - Discount percentage if applicable
- paymentTerms (number) - Days until payment due (default: 30)
- specialProvisions (text) - Additional contract terms

## Loops
- selectedServices (array) - List of services selected
  - serviceName (text)
  - serviceDescription (text)

## Conditionals
- hasDiscount (boolean) - Show discount section
- requiresApproval (boolean) - Show approval clause
```

---

### 3. Test with Sample Data

Always test templates before using in production:

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] All required variables populated
- [ ] Optional variables with empty/null values
- [ ] Arrays with 0, 1, and multiple items
- [ ] Conditionals in both true and false states
- [ ] Date formats display correctly
- [ ] Currency formats show proper symbols
- [ ] Numbers format with correct decimals
- [ ] Text transformations work (upper, lower, etc.)
- [ ] Default values appear when expected
- [ ] No placeholder text remains (e.g., `{missingVar}`)

---

### 4. Handle Missing Data Gracefully

**Use Default Values:**
```
✓ Good:
  Middle Initial: {defaultValue middleInitial "N/A"}
  Fax: {defaultValue faxNumber "Not provided"}

✗ Bad:
  Middle Initial: {middleInitial}
  (Shows nothing if empty)
```

**Check Before Displaying:**
```
✓ Good:
  {#isNotEmpty phoneNumber}
  Phone: {phoneNumber}
  {/isNotEmpty}

✗ Bad:
  Phone: {phoneNumber}
  (Shows "Phone: " with no number)
```

---

### 5. Format Data Appropriately

**Dates - Always Format:**
```
✓ Good: {formatDate signatureDate "MMMM DD, YYYY"}
✗ Bad: {signatureDate}
  (Shows: 2025-11-14T00:00:00Z - not user-friendly)
```

**Currency - Always Format:**
```
✓ Good: {formatCurrency totalAmount "USD"}
✗ Bad: ${totalAmount}
  (Shows: $5000 instead of $5,000.00)
```

**Large Numbers - Use Commas:**
```
✓ Good: {formatNumber quantity 0 true}
✗ Bad: {quantity}
  (Shows: 150000 instead of 150,000)
```

---

### 6. Keep Templates Maintainable

**Use Comments:**
```
{# This section only shows for premium clients #}
{#isPremium}
Premium Benefits:
...
{/isPremium}

{# Loop through selected services #}
{#services}
- {serviceName}
{/services}
```

**Break Complex Expressions:**
```
✗ Hard to read:
  Total: {formatCurrency (add (multiply basePrice quantity) (multiply (multiply basePrice quantity) (divide taxRate 100))) "USD"}

✓ Better (use computed variables in workflow):
  Subtotal: {formatCurrency subtotal "USD"}
  Tax: {formatCurrency taxAmount "USD"}
  Total: {formatCurrency total "USD"}
```

---

### 7. Version Control Your Templates

**Track Changes:**
- Save template files with version numbers
- Document what changed in each version
- Keep old versions as backups
- Test new versions before deploying

**Example Versioning:**
```
engagement-letter-v1.0.docx  (Initial version)
engagement-letter-v1.1.docx  (Added discount section)
engagement-letter-v2.0.docx  (Major redesign)
```

---

### 8. Provide User Guidance

**In Workflow Questions:**
```
Question: "Client's First Name"
Helptext: "This will appear in the engagement letter greeting"
Variable: firstName

Question: "Effective Date"
Helptext: "The date when services will officially begin (used in all generated documents)"
Variable: effectiveDate
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Variable Not Showing in Document

**Symptom:** Template shows `{variableName}` instead of the actual value.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Variable name mismatch**
   ```
   Template: {firstName}
   Workflow Variable: first_name

   Fix: Make sure names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   ```

2. **Variable not set**
   ```
   User skipped the question or field was optional

   Fix: Use default value:
   {defaultValue firstName "Not provided"}
   ```

3. **Wrong template mapping**
   ```
   Template expects: clientName
   Workflow has: customerName

   Fix: Update template or add alias in workflow
   ```

**How to Debug:**
1. Check variable names in workflow (look for badges in sidebar)
2. Download template and search for placeholder
3. Verify spelling and case match exactly
4. Test with sample data using Template Test Runner

---

### Problem: Date Shows as Long String

**Symptom:** Date shows as `2025-11-14T00:00:00.000Z`

**Cause:** Missing `formatDate` helper

**Fix:**
```
✗ Wrong: {effectiveDate}
✓ Correct: {formatDate effectiveDate "MMMM DD, YYYY"}
```

---

### Problem: Currency Missing Commas or Decimals

**Symptom:** Amount shows as `5000` instead of `$5,000.00`

**Cause:** Missing `formatCurrency` helper

**Fix:**
```
✗ Wrong: ${totalAmount}
✓ Correct: {formatCurrency totalAmount "USD"}
```

---

### Problem: Loop Not Repeating

**Symptom:** Loop only shows first item or nothing

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Incorrect syntax**
   ```
   ✗ Wrong: {#items}{name}{/item}
   ✓ Correct: {#items}{name}{/items}

   (Opening and closing tags must match)
   ```

2. **Variable is not an array**
   ```
   Variable should be array of objects:
   [
     { "name": "Item 1" },
     { "name": "Item 2" }
   ]

   Not a single object:
   { "name": "Item 1" }
   ```

3. **Empty array**
   ```
   Add fallback:

   {#items}
   - {name}
   {/items}

   {#isEmpty items}
   No items available.
   {/isEmpty}
   ```

---

### Problem: Conditional Always/Never Shows

**Symptom:** Content shows when it shouldn't or never shows

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Boolean value not set correctly**
   ```
   Must be: true or false
   Not: "yes", "no", 1, 0, "true", "false"
   ```

2. **Wrong variable in condition**
   ```
   Template: {#isPremium}
   Workflow Variable: premium_status

   Fix: Names must match exactly
   ```

3. **Inverted logic**
   ```
   To show when FALSE, use caret:
   {^isPremium}
   This shows for standard clients
   {/isPremium}
   ```

---

### Problem: Numbers Don't Format

**Symptom:** Numbers show too many decimals or no commas

**Fix:**
```
{formatNumber value decimalPlaces useCommas}

Examples:
{formatNumber count 0 true}      → 1,234
{formatNumber percent 2 false}   → 99.99
{formatNumber amount 2 true}     → 1,234.56
```

---

### Problem: Helper Function Not Working

**Symptom:** Helper shows as text instead of transforming

**Cause:** Template engine version

**Fix:**
Make sure Template Node config uses engine v2:
```json
{
  "templateKey": "engagement_letter",
  "bindings": { ... },
  "engine": "v2",
  "toPdf": true
}
```

---

### Problem: Special Characters Look Wrong

**Symptom:** Accented letters, symbols, or emoji don't display correctly

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Font doesn't support character**
   ```
   Fix: Use a Unicode font (Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri)
   ```

2. **Encoding issue**
   ```
   Ensure data is UTF-8 encoded
   ```

**Test String:**
```
Test: ñ é ü ö ā € £ ¥ © ® ™ • – — " " ' '
```
